A lot of inspiration was drawn from Zachtronics.

Alwinfy helped a lot with the lexing and parsing of VCC Assembly.

I'd also like to give a special thanks to Sangar_, who made a mod for Fabric emulating the TIS-100
that this mod ~~rips off~~ was inspired by.

The lowest-level computer mod ever! (May not actually be lowest-level computer mod ever.)

Build giant computers out of components you place in the world and program them in a custom assembly language!
Make 640-bit registers, overwrite opcodes other CPUs are about to execute, and stream files off your disk.
Or, do some more useful stuff, like interpret mysterious blueprints to etch circuits or precisely control giant contraptions.
